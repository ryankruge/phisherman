This is a piece of software that is capable of harvesting credentials to demonstrate how easy it is to impersonate large corporate websites in order to harvest user credentials.

This program is not intended for malice, and therefore, those who use it for such reasons are responsible for their own actions. I do not condone the use of software to perform illegal activities or carry out attacks.

Disclaimers aside, I hope that this tool can educate people.

To install the dependencies, please enter the following command while actively in the 'src' directory.
[*] "pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages"

Please ensure that you install all of the required dependencies within the requirements.txt file for full functionality.

[DO NOT] execute the installation process with root privileges; otherwise you may face issues when executing from a non-sudo account.

Please use the --break-system-packages flag while installing dependencies if you are running Python within a protected environment to bypass limitations set in place by the program.
