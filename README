This is a piece of software that is capable of harvesting credentials to demonstrate how easy it is to impersonate large corporate websites in order to harvest user credentials.

This program is not intended for malice, and therefore, those who use it for such reasons are responsible for their own actions. I do not condone the use of software to perform illegal activities or carry out attacks.

Disclaimers aside, I hope that this tool can educate people.

For correct functionality, you must place the 'fish' executable file within the '/usr/local/bin' directory and the 'fish-src' folder within the '/usr/local/src' folder.

For anybody having issues with installing this software, please ensure that you have the PHP package installed via your distributions built-in package manager. Then, if needed, please install the 'colorama' and 'art' packages via the 'pip' installer.

The default port for this software is port 8000, you may connect to the website by entering your loopback address followed by this default port.
